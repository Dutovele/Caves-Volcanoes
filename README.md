# Caves-Volcanoes
Python project involving Undirected graph, Stack structure, DFS algorithm

A tourist guide from The Ancient Volcanoes National park is planning a new series of short one-day guided walks for beginner hikers. There are two main tourist attractions in the park – volcanoes and caves. Each route will visit exactly 2 volcanoes and 2 caves. The walk will start at a cave, then go to a volcano, then proceed to another cave, then to another volcano, and finally return to a cave where it started. There are many paths which connect volcanoes and caves for more experienced hikers but the guide is choosing the direct path for beginners. 

As the input, we are given a .txt file which contains the information about the park´s size and it´s attractions.

The output contains one text line with one integer representing the total number of possible planned paths.
